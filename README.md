# My Art ON Me

## Explation 
The app I designed includes a makeup API and enables the user to search for makeup 
products through any one of 3 methods. 
The first method is by means of a search bar which directly presents the specified 
product type to the user. 
 the second method displays categories of the brands and 
new pages will be rendered when users clicks onto the name or images. 
The Last method will provide users two options (types, tags) to find items.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
