# My Art ON Me

## Explanation 
The app I designed includes a makeup API and enables the user to search for makeup 
products through any one of 3 methods. 
The first method is by means of a search bar which directly presents the specified 
product type to the user. 
 the second method displays categories of the brands and 
new pages will be rendered when users clicks onto the name or images. 
The Last method will provide users two options (types, tags) to find items.

## Goal 
The goal of my project is to provide clear search options.

##SWOT Analysis
S: Minimal design will allow users to navigate and find items quicker. W: Unclear target, lack of options (vegan, organic, and HMO free). O: On the main page, by adding images, companies will have more opportunities to promote themselves, especially if the images are of healthy products, such as vegan, organic or HMO free . T: There are many competitors that offer a large variety of healthy options
